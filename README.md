Usage

Simple Interest Formula:

SI = (P \times R \times T) / 100

Where:

P = Principal Amount

R = Annual Interest Rate (% per annum)

T = Time (in years)

Compound Interest Formula:

CI = P \times (1 + \frac{R}{n})^{(n \times T)} - P

Where:

P = Principal Amount

R = Annual Interest Rate (% per annum)

n = Number of times interest is compounded per year

T = Time (in years)
